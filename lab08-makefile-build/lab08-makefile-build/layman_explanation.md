# Layman's Explanation
A Makefile is like a checklist with buttons. Each button (target) runs the right commands in the right order.
- `make` builds the program.
- `make test` runs it to prove it works.
- `sudo make install` puts it where everyone can run it.
- We compress the folder into a `.tar.gz` so we can send the program to someone else.
